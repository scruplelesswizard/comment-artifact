# Add artifact link to Pull Requests

Comment Actions Artifacts from your Workflow Runs.

The action automatically edits Pull Requests' descriptions with link to download
one or more artifacts. This action is heavily inspired by the
[ReadTheDocs action](https://github.com/readthedocs/actions/tree/main/preview)
and [download-artofact action](https://github.com/actions/download-artifact)

## Example
